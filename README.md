# Portfolio Project - Mint Classics EDA

## Introduction
Here, I will input some information about the project and where I found the data

## Background
Here, I will explain the project scenario, as well as showing which questions my EDA will attempt to answer

## Approach
Here, I will explain the tools I'm using (SQL, MySQL, MySQLServer), and why I'm including the specific parts of the database that I am, as well as what sort of information I believe will be helpful to answering the above questions

## Analysis
Here, I will describe the steps I took to answer each of the questions, as well as showing the code that I used to do so

## Findings
Here, I will show, using visualizations(?), what the data is suggesting

## Conclusions
Here, I will provide my suggestions to resolve the business questions, as well as next steps, and potentially I'll include some further steps that could be taken, past the original questions
