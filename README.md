# Portfolio Project - Mint Classics EDA

## Introduction
Here, I will input some information about the project and where I found the data

## Background
The scenario for this project was as follows:

>_Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking at closing one of their storage facilities._

>_To support a data-based business decision, they are looking for suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory, while still maintaining timely service to their customers. For example, they would like to be able to ship a product to a customer within 24 hours of the order being placed._

In this exploratory analysis, I seek to answer three questions:

1) Where are items stored and if they were rearranged, could a warehouse be eliminated?
2) How are inventory numbers related to sales figures? Do the inventory counts seem appropriate for each item?
3) Are we storing items that are not moving? Are any items candidates for being dropped from the product line?

## Approach
Here, I will explain the tools I'm using (SQL, MySQL, MySQLServer), and why I'm including the specific parts of the database that I am, as well as what sort of information I believe will be helpful to answering the above questions

## Analysis
Here, I will describe the steps I took to answer each of the questions, as well as showing the code that I used to do so

## Findings
Here, I will show, using visualizations(?), what the data is suggesting

### Question 1 - Where are items stored and if they were rearranged, could a warehouse be eliminated?

### Question 2 - How are inventory numbers related to sales figures? Do the inventory counts seem appropriate for each item?

| Inventory Level | Occurrences |
|---|---|
|'Not enough in stock to meet demand'|'13'|
|'Low'|'26'|
|'High'|'222'|
|'Approriate'|'66'|

### Question 3 - Are we storing items that are not moving? Are any items candidates for being dropped from the product line?

## Conclusions
Here, I will provide my suggestions to resolve the business questions, as well as next steps, and potentially I'll include some further steps that could be taken, past the original questions
